FPGA Example

We do not distribute example Quartus projects to avoid violations of the
software license agreement. However, we do provide a synthesis script to
synthesize a design once the Quartus project has been set up. The following
steps describe the process of setting up a quartus project for the Trireme
platform. These steps assume you are comfortable using Quartus.


Step 1.
- Create a blank quartus project in this directory named trireme_example.
- Add all of the source files in the rtl directory to the project.

Step 2.
- Be sure the project is targeting the correct FPGA device.
- Create an FPGA-specific top module that instantiates on of the example processor
  systems in rtl/tops/src. The single_cycle_BRAM_top is a simple example to start
  with.
- In the FPGA specific top module, instantiate and FPGA specific IP, such as
  PLLs or memory controllers.

Step 3.
- Make sure to set the FPGA-specific top module as the projects top-level entity.

Step 4.
- Run the provided synthesis script: ./synth
- The script will generate the bit-stream and systhesis reports and write them
  to an output_files directory. This is just like the Quartus GUI functionality.

Step 5.
- Connect your FPGA to your workstation.
- Run "quartus_pgm -l" to determine the name of the FPGA programming chain.
- You will see an output similar to the following

Step 6.
- Edit the program script with the correct chain name for your system.
- In the example above, the chain name is "DE5 Standard [4-3]"
- Run the program script to configure the FPGA with your synthesized bit stream:
  "./program"
