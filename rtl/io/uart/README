UART

This UART supports 8n1 data transmit and receive at a configurable bit rate.
BIT rates up to 1M bits/second have been tested. The clock ticks per UART-bit
is calculated with a CLOCK_FREQUENCY and BAUD_RATE parameter. FIFOs are
included to buffer messages. The FIFO depth is configurable with a parameter.
