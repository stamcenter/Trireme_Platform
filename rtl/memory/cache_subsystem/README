Cache Subsystem

The trireme platofrm supports a configurable cache hierarchy. Each cahce
supports a configurable line size, number of ways and number of indexes.
Hierarchy wrappers can be configured to support an arbitrary number of L1
caches, enabling multi-core systems.

The base directory includes modules shared among the L1 and Lx cache modules.
The L1_cache directory includes the L1 cache and associated control modules.
The Lx_cache directory includes the Lx cahce which is used to implement L2 and
greater cache modules. The hierarchies directory includes wrappers for complete
cache hierarchies.
