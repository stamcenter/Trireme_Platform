Lx Cache

The Lx cache modules provide support and connections for L2 and greater caches.
One side of the Lx cache connects to an L1 cache, or another Lx cache closer
to the CPU through a coherent bus. The other side of the Lx cache connects to
main memory or another Lx cache closer to the main memory.

The Lx cache supports configurable line size, number of ways, and number of
indexes.
