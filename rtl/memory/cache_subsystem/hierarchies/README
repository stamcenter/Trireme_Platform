Cache Hierarchies

The hierarchies wrap L1 and Lx cache modules to create a single hierarchy that
interfaces with CPUs and main memory.

Currently only configurations for a two-level coherent cache hierarchy is
included. The two level cache hierarchy provides coherent memory to one or more
CPU cores. Two L1 caches per core communicate with the L2 cache through a single
bus.
