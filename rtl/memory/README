Memory

These subdirectories provide the different memory subsystems of the Trireme
Platform. The base directory includes modules, such as BRAMs, that are shared
among more than one memory subsystem. The single_cycle_memory directory provides
the asynchronous main-memory needed for the single-cycle and five-stage cores
to fetch instructions without stalling. The dual_port_BRAM_memory provides
a synchronous FPGA BRAM main memory. The main_memory directory provides a
synchronous main memory compatible with the cache hierarchy, which is in the
cache_subsystem directory.
