Main Memory

The main_memory module provides a synchronus BRAM memory that is compatible with
the cache hierarchy. Because it iterfaces with the cache hierarchy, instead of
a CPU core, it does not need to support writes to arbitrary bytes in a word of
memory. Therefor, it supports memory initialization with a simple PROGRAM
parameter, instead of the bite-wise split memory files required by the dual port
BRAM memory subsystem.
