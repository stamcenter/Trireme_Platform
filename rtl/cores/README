Core Designs

The sub-directories here include modules dedicated to the Trireme RISC-V CPU
cores. The "Base" modules are shared among multiple cores and include files
such as the ALU. The remaining sub-directories include modules unique to each
type of core, such as specific control units and the core modules themselves.
