Five Stage Pipelined Core

The core base modules and the five-stage modules here form a pipelined RV32I
core with five pipeline stages. The Five Stage Core includes Fetch, Decode,
Execution, Memory, and Writeback stages. Some base modules are wrapped with
additional logic specific to this five stage core. The fetch and memory stages
each take a single cycle, i.e the instruction and data memory reads must happen
combinationally or the core will stall. If BRAM memories or a cache hierarchy
are used, the core will stall every other cycle while the BRAM or cache is read.
The seven stage core prevents stalls with an additional pipeline stage between
ssue and receive stages.
