Single Cycle Core

The single cycle core is the simplest core. It combines the base fetch, decode,
execute, memory, and writeback modules to form an RV32I CPU core that executes
instructions in a single cycle. Memory reads must be asynchronous (see the
single_cycle_memory_subsystem module) to prevent stalls. Using the BRAM or
cache hierarchy means the core will stall while the synchronous memory is read.
